        <h2 class="section-title">What is Gender-Based Violence Against Males?</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            Gender-based violence (GBV) against males refers to harmful acts directed at men and boys based on their gender.
            This form of violence is often underreported and can include physical, sexual, and emotional abuse, as well as
            economic deprivation. Societal norms and stereotypes about masculinity often discourage male victims from seeking help.

    <!-- Section 2: Impact of Gender-Based Violence on Males -->
    <div class="education-section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Impact of Gender-Based Violence on Males</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            The impact of GBV on males can be profound and long-lasting. Victims may experience physical injuries, mental health issues
            such as depression and anxiety, and social stigma. The reluctance to report abuse can lead to a lack of support and resources
            for male victims, further exacerbating their suffering.

        <p class="section-content">
            <span class="important">1. Break the Silence:</span> It is crucial to speak out and break the silence surrounding male victimization.
            Sharing your experiences with trusted friends, family, or support groups can be the first step towards healing.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
            <span class="important">2. Access Resources:</span> Look for local organizations, hotlines, and support groups that specifically
            cater to male victims of GBV. These resources can provide the necessary support and guidance.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
            <span class="important">3. Legal Protection:</span> Understanding your legal rights can empower you to take action against the abuser.
            Many regions have laws in place to protect victims of GBV, regardless of gender.
